                Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", <br>
                followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician<br>
                 Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance <br>
                 of the patent was made clear when the American rights<br>
                 to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T),<br>
                  making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made <br>
                  little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led <br>
                  by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's <br>
                 own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely<br>
                  valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and<br>
                   especially submarine ones.</p>
